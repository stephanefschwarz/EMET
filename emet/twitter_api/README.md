# Get Tweets by IDs

This repository contains the source code used to get Tweets from Twitter through your IDs. I used the [python-twitter](https://pypi.org/project/python-twitter/) library.

## Important

To use that you need a Twitter App credential in a json file like below:

```json

{"twitter_credentials" : 
	{

	"CONSUMER_KEY" : "Your CONSUMER_KEY here",
	"CONSUMER_SECRET" : "Your CONSUMER_SECRET here",
	"ACCESS_TOKEN" : "Your ACCESS_TOKEN here",
	"ACCESS_SECRET" : "Your ACCESS_SECRET here"
	}
}

```
